`Python Password Manager`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main objective of the Python password manager is to manage the passwords for multiple webapps, sites, and Applications for easy remember of user, so that they will never forget their password’s, it basically uses a hashing function to hash the string / password to save in the database with a hardcoded salt, and when you view the password, it will show you the hashed password and copy the original password in your clipboard. Python is a major language in today’s world and in the field of Cybersecurity and Infosec, and python works with MySQL to store password in Database. That’s the small glimpse of our project.
